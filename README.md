# face_prediction_office

Made for fun at the office. 12 faces with names were the traning set, which is not uploaded.
This is run with a command line on the raspberry Pi, where the video camera starts filming, and guesses the name of the person on camera if probability reaches a certain level.
Three consecutive frames with the same prediction (and high proba) is required to make the assumption. An mp3 file is played saying the name of the indiviual.
